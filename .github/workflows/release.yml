# **what?**
# Release workflow provides the following steps:
# - checkout the given commit;
# - validate version in sources and changelog file for given version;
# - bump the version and generate a changelog if needed;
# - merge all changes to the target branch if needed;
# - run unit and integration tests against given commit;
# - build and package that SHA;
# - release it to GitHub and PyPI with that specific build;
#
# **why?**
# Ensure an automated and tested release process
#
# **when?**
# This workflow can be run manually on demand or can be called by other workflows
